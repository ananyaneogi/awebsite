    <p>Enchanting Travels offers tailor-made travel experiences across 40 countries, which has been operational for more than a decade now. This has been a long-term project on which I have worked for more than a year. I have had the opportunity to work on many of the different facets  starting from customer-facing interface to their internal booking and management interface.</p>
    <p>Being a part of a tight-knit team of designers and developers, rapid prototyping has been a part of the process since day one, undertaking number of iterations based on internal reviews and most importantly through user testing. “Travelmaker”, their flagship product which helps the Travel Consultants in planning, booking trip itineraries, maintaining financial aspects of the booking and many other tasks like so, has evolved from version 0.5 to 2.0 during this course of time.</p>

    <p>We started with simple HTML/CSS prototypes and evolved to VueJS. We also recently started using 'Storybook' that helps build the UI components interactively.</p>
    <p>Maintaining a consistent design language while working on such a major application becomes a tough feat. The designers of the team created a visual language to overcome this challenge. I undertook the code refactor of the entire application to implement the new visual language to make the whole experience cohesive.</p>

      <p>I believe every project no matter how big or small teaches you something you didn’t know before. I had a great learning experience while working on this particular project, I have not only improved with leaps and bounds in the quality of code that I write but also learnt a great deal about teamwork and better time management.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>&mdash; Maintaining the codebase of an application of this scale has been a challenge but also a great learning opportunity.</li>
        <li>&mdash; Learning how to collaborate with different teams situated in different places to gain maximum productivity and efficient results.</li>
        <li>&mdash; I learnt first hand, the importance of communication with your teammates so that everyone is on the same page and working towards one common goal.</li>
